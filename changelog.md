---

## [2.0.0 - 2.0.2] 2021-07-22

### Changed

- Breaking change: removed support for Node.js 10.x (now EOL, and no longer available to created in AWS Lambda) and Node.js 12.x
- Breaking change: removed legacy `hydrate()` interface, usage should now always be `hydrate.install(opts)`, `hydrate.update(opts)`, or `hydrate.shared(opts)`; fixes #1168

- Improved output of terminal information being returned, especially in error scenarios

---

## [1.10.1 - 1.10.2] 2021-06-20

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where `@architect/functions` `arc.static()` method may not work if using `@static fingerprint true`, but aren't using `src/shared` or `@static src some-dir`


### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.10.0] 2021-06-15

### Added

- Added `cwd` API param, making it easier to run Hydrate in different project directories
  - Since `cwd` and `basepath` have similar characteristics, please refer to the readme for usage!
- Added ability to pass API an `inventory` object (to prevent extra Inventory runs and avoid potential state issues)


### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.9.11] 2021-05-24

### Fixed

- Hydration of plugin Lambdas now supports either plugin interface method
    `functions` or `pluginFunctions`.

---

## [1.9.10] 2021-05-17

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where Hydrate might get a bit overly aggressive and remove root dependencies during Lambda treeshaking; thanks @ryanbethel!

---

## [1.9.9] 2021-04-26

### Fixed

- Fixed `views` not hydrating in projects that don't use `shared`; fixes [#1133](https://github.com/architect/architect/issues/1133)

---

## [1.9.8] 2021-04-21

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where multiple lambdas aliased to the same source path would cause an error when hydrating `src/shared`; fixes [#1124](https://github.com/architect/architect/issues/1124)

---

## [1.9.7] 2021-04-12

### Fixed

- Fixed support for Lambdas created via `@plugins` to be hydrated with `src/shared`

---

## [1.9.6] 2021-03-02

### Added

- Add support for Lambdas created via `@plugins` to be hydrated

---

## [1.9.4 - 1.9.5] 2021-01-27

---

## [1.9.3] 2021-01-23

### Fixed

- Fixed printing correct number of functions to hydrate when Lambda treeshaking is involved

---


## [1.9.0 - 1.9.2] 2020-12-05

### Added

- Added support for automated dependency management (aka Lambda treeshaking) via `autoinstall` param
  - This feature currently only supports Node.js dependencies


### Fixed

- Fixed `npm` + `yarn` calls installing developer dependencies in Lambdas; fixes #1034, thanks @BenoitAverty!
- Fixed shared/views autoinstall package.json paths and path printing

---

## [1.8.0] 2020-12-03

### Added

- Added support for new `@shared` pragma with selective shared code, uh, sharing
- Added support for custom shared + views file paths


### Fixed

- Fixed obscure circumstance where moving or deleting a symlinked shared/views folder can crash hydration
  - Shared file copier now always deletes destination file dirs before writing instead of checking existence (which may result in false negatives for existence)

---

## [1.7.0] 2020-11-23

### Added

- Added support for custom file paths


### Changed

- Implemented Inventory (`@architect/inventory`)


### Fixed

- Ensure we don't create folders that don't already exist when copying shared / Arc files

---

## [1.6.2] 2020-11-04

### Fixed

- When using Yarn, detect local vs global installs, and prefer local installs where found (via `npx` call)

---

## [1.6.1] 2020-10-19

### Fixed

- Fixed weird side effects that can sometimes occur when toggling between symlink enabled/disabled with `@aws shared false` in a function config

---

## [1.6.0] 2020-10-15

### Added

- Added a `symlink` flag, which causes files and directories to be symlinked instead of copied (whenever the filesystem supports it). This should significantly improve performance in local workflows, such as Sandbox. Thanks @joliss!

---

## [1.5.1] 2020-09-30

### Added

- Add support for `@http` catchall syntax (e.g. `get /api/*`)


### Changed

### Changed

- Updated dependencies

---

## [1.4.5 - 1.4.7] 2019-09-29

### Added

- Added `hydrateShared` param (defaults `true`) to `install` and `update`; disabling deactivates hydrating `src/shared` and `src/views`, useful when only trying to hydrat dependencies for a single directory

### Changed

---

## [1.4.4] 2019-09-25

### Added

- Adds ability to target specific shared file operations by passing an `only` param to `hydrate.shared`

### Changed

- Update dependencies

---

## [1.4.2 - 1.4.3] 2019-09-17

### Added

- In `hydrate.install` and `hydrate.update` shared copying is still enabled by default on all operations, but now you can opt out by passing a `copyShared` param


### Changed

- Internal change: moved tests into specific unit + integration dirs


### Fixed

- Fixed issue where shared file copy destination paths may leak across Lambda executions
- Fixed undefined message in init
- Improved printer error bubbling
- Formatting and line breaks in printer return should now more closely (or exactly) match console output
- Cleaned up printer API and implementation

---

## [1.4.1] 2019-09-11

### Changed

- `hydrate.update` now properly inventories its update operations, avoiding superfluous work
- Internal cleanup of printing operations using new Architect-standardized `updater`
- Results returned by `hydrate` are now symmetrical with what's printed
- Numerous internal changes to clean up common code paths and simplify key operations, like printing & reporting

---

## [1.4.0] 2019-09-06

### Added

- All `hydrate` printing is now silenced by using `quiet`


### Changed

- `hydrate.install` now properly inventories its update operations, avoiding superfluous work
- `hydrate.install` now accepts absolute `basepath` values (e.g. `/full/path/to/your/project`)
- `hydrate.install` and `hydrate.update` now always run `hydrate.shared`
- `hydrate.shared` now accepts parameters
